# Iteration Context for Reward Revision

This is the single compact context file for the next reward revision LLM.
Do not treat expert cards as templates; use them as diagnostic guidance.

## Previous Training Feedback

## 2. External evaluation
- mean_eval_reward: -107.815746
- mean_episode_length: 72.000000
- min_eval_reward: -124.079149
- max_eval_reward: -95.059093

## 3. Reward execution health
- reward_error_count_max: 0

## 4. Key component evidence
- progress_reward mean: 0.160032, nonzero_rate: 0.999997
- stability_penalty mean: -0.342734, abs_mean: 0.342734

## 5. Preliminary failure hints
- likely_failure_mode: early_failure_or_crash
- evidence: negative external reward and short episode length
- likely_issue: stability penalty may dominate progress signal

## Short Memory

## Stable Lessons

- Use external evaluation reward as the fitness signal; generated reward alone is not enough.
- Keep terminal_success_reward blocked until an explicit success signal is available.
- Keep terminal_failure_penalty blocked until failure reason is available.
- Contact flags are only usable inside a guarded landing proxy: near target + low speed + stable angle + contact.
- Avoid speed or stability penalties dominating the main progress signal.
- Avoid a hard sparse completion bonus as the only landing guidance.
- Keep memory short: record component structure, key evidence, diagnosis, and next action only.

## Latest Iter Detail

### iter_1

- reward_structure: energy_penalty + landing_bonus + progress_reward + stability_penalty
- external_score: -107.82
- mean_episode_length: 72.00
- reward_error_count: 0

#### component_evidence

- progress 0.160; stability -0.343

#### diagnosis

- early_failure_or_crash

#### next_action

- add smoother approach/landing guidance

## Matched Expert Cards

## early_failure_or_crash

- signal: negative external score and short episode length
- risk: reward does not guide stable control before termination
- fix: add smooth approach/landing signals; avoid relying on sparse terminal-like proxy

## Skeleton Revision Plan

### keep
- progress_delta_reward

### weaken
- none

### revise
- none

### consider_add
- distance_reward as a small anchor if progress-only guidance remains weak

### still_defer
- terminal_success_reward
- terminal_failure_penalty
- energy_penalty
- time_penalty
- gated_reward

## Reward Revision Boundary

- Revise the previous reward instead of generating from scratch.
- Keep the function signature unchanged.
- Do not use original_reward or unavailable info fields.
- Do not add terminal success/failure rewards without explicit signals.
- Prefer fewer components with clear roles over adding many skeletons.
