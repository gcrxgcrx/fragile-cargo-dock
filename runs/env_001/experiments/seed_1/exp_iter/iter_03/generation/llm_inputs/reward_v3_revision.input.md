# Iteration Context for Reward Revision

This is the single compact context file for the next reward revision LLM.
Do not treat expert cards as templates; use them as diagnostic guidance.

## Previous Training Feedback

## 2. External evaluation
- mean_eval_reward: -39.015850
- mean_episode_length: 1000.000000
- min_eval_reward: -69.999802
- max_eval_reward: -12.536803

## 3. Reward execution health

## 4. Key component evidence
- stability_penalty mean: -0.068771, abs_mean: 0.068771

## 5. Preliminary failure hints

## Short Memory

## Stable Lessons

- Use external evaluation reward as the fitness signal; generated reward alone is not enough.
- Keep terminal_success_reward blocked until an explicit success signal is available.
- Keep terminal_failure_penalty blocked until failure reason is available.
- Contact flags are only usable inside a guarded landing proxy: near target + low speed + stable angle + contact.
- Avoid speed or stability penalties dominating the main progress signal.
- Avoid a hard sparse completion bonus as the only landing guidance.
- Keep memory short: record component structure, key evidence, diagnosis, and next action only.

## Skeleton Revision Plan

### consider_add

### still_defer

## Reward Revision Boundary

- Revise the previous reward instead of generating from scratch.
- Keep the function signature unchanged.
- Do not use original_reward or unavailable info fields.
- Do not add terminal success/failure rewards without explicit signals.
- Prefer fewer components with clear roles over adding many skeletons.
